    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails <br> </h2>
    <dl>
        <strong>
        <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
        </strong>
          <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.<br> 
            Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a <br>
            roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
        <strong>
        <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
        </strong>
          <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and <br>
            gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity <br> 
            and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom <br>
            facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
        <strong>
        <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
        </strong>
          <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for <br>
            changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to <br>
            bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
