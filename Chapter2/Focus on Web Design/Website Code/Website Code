    <h1>Appealing Website</h1>
    <h2>Question 1: What is the URL of the website?</h2>
    <p>https://www.google.com/</p>
    
    <h2>Question 2: Is the page appealing or unappealing? List three reasons for your answer.</h2>
    <p>I found this page to be appealing for a couple reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The page is nice to look at and also quite simple in design, which helps users not be overwhelmed</li>
        <li>The page has easy to use links to other parts of the Google browser, like Google images</li>
        <li>The page has a nice big logo, with a simple search bar to search for material on the Internet</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Question 3: If the page is unappealing, what would you do to improve it?</h2>
    <h2>Question 4: Would you encourage others to visit this site? Why or why not?</h2>
    <p>I would encourage others to visit this site since it is simple to use and quite visually pleasing</p>

    <h1>Unappealing Website</h1>
    <h2>Question 1: What is the URL of the website?</h2>
    <p>https://www.art.yale.edu/</p>
        
    <h2>Question 2: Is the page appealing or unappealing? List three reasons for your answer.</h2>
    <p>I found this page to be unappealing for a couple reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The page has too many varying fonts and colors, and makes the website look overwhelming and kind of ugly</li>
        <li>The page has weird layouts for its elements on the screen</li>
        <li>The page's navigation area is weirdly desgined and has a weird layout</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2>Question 3: If the page is unappealing, what would you do to improve it?</h2>
    <p>I would change colors and font sizes first, and then resdesign the layout of all of the elements on the screen</p>

    <h2>Question 4: Would you encourage others to visit this site? Why or why not?</h2>
    <p>I would not encourage others to visit this website. Because of the design mistakes on this website, the website is hard to look at and navigate</p>
